> **Bumper** is a self-hosted central server for Ecovacs vacuum robots.
> It replaces the Ecovacs cloud, giving you full local control through a privacy-first,
> high-performance stack: Python + uv, Docker Swarm, and NGINX.

![Web-UI Preview](docs/images/web-ui.png)

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Self-Hosted**: Operate without Ecovacs cloud servers.
- **Privacy-First**: All data stays within your network.
- **High Performance**: Built on Python 3.13.x with [uv](https://pypi.org/project/uv/) for efficient async I/O.
- **Docker Swarm & Compose**: One-command startup with turnkey NGINX configuration.
- **Modular**: Easily extend protocols and add integrations.

> **⚠️ Warning**: Branches `main`/`dev` are under active development and may be unstable. Use at your own risk.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Prepare TLS certificates and minimal environment variables before any deployment:

**TLS certificates**:

Bumper automatically generates certificates on first startup. Alternatively, place your own certs in `certs/ca.crt`, `certs/bumper.crt`, `certs/bumper.key`.

**Environment variables**:

Create a `.env` file with at least the following:

```env
NETWORK_MODE=overlay        # by default "bridge"

# Needs to be set when running with Docker; default is auto-detected from socket
BUMPER_ANNOUNCE_IP=192.168.0.100  # your server's public/local IP

# Optional: comma-separated MQTT users that bypass robot/client state handling
BUMPER_MQTT_ADMIN_USERS=admin
```

Full configuration options are available in the [Wiki](https://MVladislav.github.io/bumper/infos/Env_Var/).

### Home Assistant OS Add-on

This repository can also be added directly to the Home Assistant OS add-on store:

```text
https://github.com/vvd214/bumper
```

Before starting the add-on, copy the personal Bumper data folder to:

```text
/share/bumper
```

The add-on image is published by GitHub Actions to:

```text
ghcr.io/vvd214/aarch64-addon-bumper
```

The repository also includes an `Nginx Certbot` HAOS add-on based on
[`jonasal/nginx-certbot`](https://github.com/JonasAlfredsson/docker-nginx-certbot).
It uses the same `/share/bumper` data folder for `configs/nginx.conf`,
`configs/user_conf.d`, and `configs/letsencrypt`.

### ✨ Docker Swarm Deployment

**Step 1 – Clone the repository**

```sh
$git clone https://github.com/MVladislav/bumper.git
$cd bumper
```

**Step 2 – Initiate Docker in Swarm mode**

```sh
$docker swarm init
```

**Step 3 – Start services**

> alias for [docker-swarm](https://github.com/MVladislav/.dotfiles/blob/0b069b6a8435a43037789d8b5c4e1c0c65c6a142/zsh/profile-append#L146)

```sh
$docker-swarm-compose deebot      # alias for Docker Swarm Compose
# or
$docker compose up -d             # standard Docker Compose
```

**Step 4 – Open the UI**

Visit `https://ecovacs.net/` in your browser.
